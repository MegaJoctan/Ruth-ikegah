### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Ruth Ikegah, a self-taught Python developer, technical writer, [Github star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/ruth-ikegah/), public speaker, open-source enthusiast, and a peopleâ€™s person. I grew up in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Microbiology. I am sparked about onboarding beginners into the tech system, especially the open-source space.
